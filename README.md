## How to install

## Concept

### Research Question

"How many parkingmeters got added trough a year within a certain city"

### Expected datapoints

- Date
- Coordinates

### Expected findings

I expect to find a gain in cities that have high work traffic, like Amsterdam, Utrecht and the Hague. Because the Netherlands is trying to discourage people to travel by care and encoure traveling by public transport. One of the reasons is to minimize the polution above bigger cities.
